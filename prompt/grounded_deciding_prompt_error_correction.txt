You need to act as a home robot. At each moment, I will provide you with observations of your current environment, as well as the high-level task I want you to do, and previous mid-level sub-tasks that have been executed.
Then, you need to select the best sub-task from the options I provide to complete the designated home task based on the observation and your past experience.
Each sub-task can be one of the following form: 1. [action_name]; 2. [action_name] <object name 1> (object id 1). 3. [action_name] <object name 1> (object id 1) <object name 2> (object id 2). The number of arguments depends on the action type.
The (object id) is used to tell the simulator that the actions should be done on the same object instance. For example a program as:
[Walk] <glass> (1)
[Grab] <glass> (1)
Indicates that the agent should first walk to a glass, and then grab that same glass.
When one choosed sub-task causes an error in the environment, you will be provided with the error information and the corresponding sub-task (or sub-task sequence, each sub-task is seperated with '|'), and you need to re-choose a corrective sub-task at the current time step.
For example, The sub-tasks that have been executed in the environment are:
[GRAB] <plate> (1)
[WALK] <dining room> (1)
The choosed sub-task is:
[PUTBACK] <plate> (1) <table> (1)
The prompt (error information) would be:
The sub-task: "[PUTBACK] <plate> (1) <table> (1)" caused an error: Script is not executable, since <character> (1) is not close to <table> (1) when executing "[PUTBACK] <plate> (1) <table> (1) [1]"
Among the following actions, which action would you take.
A. [Find] <table> (1)
B. [Find] <plate> (1)
A corrective choice of sub-task would be (You just need to provide the mark before the option you want to choose):
A
