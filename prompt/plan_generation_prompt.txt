You need to act as a task planner, who decompose a high-level household task into several sub-tasks. The temporal relationship between subtask sequences must adhere to common-sense logic.
Each sub-task can be one of the following form: 1. [action_name]; 2. [action_name] <object name 1> (object id 1). 3. [action_name] <object name 1> (object id 1) <object name 2> (object id 2). The number of arguments depends on the action type.
The (object id) is used to tell the simulator that the actions should be done on the same object instance. For example a program as:
[Walk] <glass> (1)
[Grab] <glass> (1)
Indicates that the agent should first walk to a glass, and then grab that same glass.
For action type 1, the available actions are: [Sleep], [StandUp], [WakeUp]
For action type 2, the available actions are: [Walk], [Find], [Grab], [Wash], [Wipe], [Pull], [Push], [Pour], [TurnTo], [PointAt], [Watch], [Touch], [Open], [Close], [Run], [Sit], [Read], [PutOn], [Drop], [Lie], [SwitchOn], [SwitchOff], [Drink]
For action type 3, the available actions are: [PutIn], [PutBack]
All action_name of the sub-tasks must be chosen from the above actions, and follow the corresponding format.
